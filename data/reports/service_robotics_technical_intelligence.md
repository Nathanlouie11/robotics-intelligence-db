**INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENT**: The service robotics sector is transitioning from "lab curiosity" to "production viability" in 2024-2025, driven by foundation model integration and Chinese manufacturing cost curves. Critical inflection point: Q2 2025, when Tesla Optimus and Figure 02 enter volume manufacturing. Recommendation: Monitor solid-state battery developments (Toyota/Panasonic) and ISO safety standard finalization as primary gating factors for Fortune 500 deployment at scale.
