## INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENT

The service robotics sector is undergoing a fundamental paradigm shift from **specialized, single-purpose machines** to **generalist, foundation-model-driven physical agents**. The quantitative data reveals a bifurcated market: mature applications (logistics, cleaning) are scaling via RaaS business models (31% fleet growth), while medical robotics experiences explosive expansion (91% growth, 16,700 units) driven by surgical autonomy advances. 

The critical inflection point is Google's Gemini Robotics 1.5, which introduces **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models with Motion Transfer**—potentially collapsing the cost structure for new robot development by enabling zero-shot generalization across embodiments. This threatens to commoditize the "brain" of service robots, shifting value capture to sensor/actuator hardware and data moats.

However, **technical debt remains substantial**: the 2,476% growth in inspection/maintenance masks a low base (~2,800 units), indicating infrastructure robotics is still pre-early majority. Power density (4-hour average endurance) and manipulation costs ($50k+ per arm) continue to gate humanoid deployment despite Tesla and Figure AI's aggressive roadmaps. 

**Strategic Implications**: Organizations should prioritize RaaS partnerships for immediate logistics ROI while monitoring VLA model development for 2026-2027 generalist robot integration. The 944 global producers (80% SMEs) face consolidation pressure as foundation models standardize software stacks. Government funding ($1.4B China, €1.2B EU) suggests geopolitical competition for robotics manufacturing capacity will intensify, aligning with [Stanford's assessment](https://setr.stanford.edu/technology/robotics/2025) that robotics is critical for supply chain resilience and eldercare demographics.

**Watch List**: Battery chemistry breakthroughs (solid-state), dexterous end-effector cost curves (<$5k target), and the sim-to-real gap closure for home robotics (currently 35% task completion vs. 70% lab performance).
