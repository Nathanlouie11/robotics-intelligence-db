## INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENT

The construction robotics sector is undergoing a paradigm shift from **single-task automation** (bricklaying, concreting) toward **general-purpose platforms**, specifically modular reconfigurable systems and humanoid robots. The 2024–2025 period marks critical validation milestones: IIT's CONCERT system demonstrates sub-10-minute reconfiguration for multi-task operations [arxiv.org], while ETH Zurich's framework enables sustainable construction using on-site materials [science.org]. However, significant technical debt remains in **perceptual robustness** and **adaptive locomotion** for unstructured environments, with McKinsey estimating a **10-year horizon** for large-scale humanoid deployment [mckinsey.com]. Academic activity is robust (16,000+ accesses for recent sector reviews), yet commercial R&D spending figures remain undisclosed, suggesting strategic opacity among major contractors. Immediate opportunities exist in **human-robot collaborative workflows** (TRL 6), while human-level dexterity and continual learning remain medium-term research targets. Regulatory frameworks lag technical capability, creating entry barriers for pilot deployments despite proven modular hardware viability.
