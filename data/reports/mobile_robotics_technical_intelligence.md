**Intelligence Assessment**: The mobile robotics sector is transitioning from "pilot purgatory" to early commercial deployment, with AMRs achieving economic viability while humanoids remain 3-5 years from mass adoption. Critical gating factors include battery energy density (current 200 Wh/kg insufficient for 16-hour shifts) and unit cost reduction (requires 80% decrease from current $200k price points). Investment velocity ($4.3B+ in 2024) indicates market confidence in technical trajectory, though sustained uptime metrics (60-70% for humanoids) lag industrial requirements (95%+).
